is requesting that you coordinate benefits with them. If you could 
get ahold of your insurance as soon as possible so they can release 
benefits. Thank you and feel free to contact our office at any time

Scribus sounds promising:
scribus - Open Source Desktop Page Layout - stable branch
scribus-data - Open Source Desktop Page Layout - stable branch (data files)
scribus-dev - Open Source Desktop Page Layout - stable branch (development files)
scribus-template - additional scribus templates

@thejoshwolfe I highly recommend trying out Scribus instead of 
LibreOffice Draw.  I had the same issue where LibreOffice was 
mangling the imported PDF so that it did not look like the 
original anymore.  I tried importing the original into Scribus
 and it worked perfectly. – wheeler

.ICEauthority
  "Basically ICE is a inter process communication
  protocol, with authentication, protocol negotiation 
  and potentially multiplexing built in.

  It allows two X clients to talk directly to each 
  other, for example, a video player program could 
  potentially talk to a jukebox program to update each 
  other.

  As Richard Holloway says, the .ICEAuthority file is 
  for authentication.  It contains a number of random 
  cookies.  If two programs have the same cookie, then 
  they're allowed to talk to each other.  In practice
  this either means that they're reading the same
  .ICEAuthority file, or the cookies have been added.

  In a lot of ways it's similar to the xauth program
  the .Xauthority file, except that .ICEAuthority is
  used for client to client, while .Xauthority is for
  client to server."

  Once an X session is started, the cookie is used to
  authenticate connections to that specific display.  You
  can find more info on X authentication and X authority in
  the xauth man pages (type man xauth in a terminal).

  So, if you are not the owner of this file you can't login
