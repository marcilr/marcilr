.ICEauthority
  "Basically ICE is a inter process communication
  protocol, with authentication, protocol negotiation 
  and potentially multiplexing built in.

  It allows two X clients to talk directly to each 
  other, for example, a video player program could 
  potentially talk to a jukebox program to update each 
  other.

  As Richard Holloway says, the .ICEAuthority file is 
  for authentication.  It contains a number of random 
  cookies.  If two programs have the same cookie, then 
  they're allowed to talk to each other.  In practice
  this either means that they're reading the same
  .ICEAuthority file, or the cookies have been added.

  In a lot of ways it's similar to the xauth program
  the .Xauthority file, except that .ICEAuthority is
  used for client to client, while .Xauthority is for
  client to server."

.profile
  ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.

  the files are located in the bash-doc package.

.ssh/
  Openssh security certificates and such.
  NOTE: Authentication, do not commit to git.

.Xauthority
  "The .Xauthority (not .xAuthority) file can be found in
  each user home directory and is used to store credentials
  in cookies used by xauth for authentication of X sessions.
  Once an X session is started, the cookie is used to
  authenticate connections to that specific display.  You
  can find more info on X authentication and X authority in
  the xauth man pages (type man xauth in a terminal).

  So, if you are not the owner of this file you can't login
  since you can't store your credentials there."

  NOTE: Given authentication of X sessions should not commit
