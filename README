================================
o Under gmail created new Kara Stocker label, For Dr. Kara Stocker,
and moved all her messages to it

9:30-10:30AM Zoom meeting with Dr. Stocker with plenty of discussion on 
my decline and how I should be using CPAP.  Agreed to use it then do
testing after a year...

================================
Scribus sounds promising:
scribus - Open Source Desktop Page Layout - stable branch
scribus-data - Open Source Desktop Page Layout - stable branch (data files)
scribus-dev - Open Source Desktop Page Layout - stable branch (development files)
scribus-template - additional scribus templates

@thejoshwolfe I highly recommend trying out Scribus instead of 
LibreOffice Draw.  I had the same issue where LibreOffice was 
mangling the imported PDF so that it did not look like the 
original anymore.  I tried importing the original into Scribus
 and it worked perfectly. â€“ wheeler

This installed Scribus 1.4.8 Open Source Desktop Publishing software

Scribus fails to open:

Found PDFEdit has dependency issues:
o Build pdfedit-0.4.5:

Expand PDFedit tarball:
$ cd /usr/local/src
$ tar jxvpf 00TARBALLS/pdfedit/pdfedit-0.4.5.tar.bz2


Create freetype-config (dependency) symlink to /usr/bin/pkg-config:
$ cd ~/bin
~/bin$ ln -s /usr/bin/pkg-config freetype-config

o Set QTDIR environment variable to alleviate:
$ cd /usr/local/src/pdfedit-0.4.5
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
...
configure: error: QTDIR environment variable must be set

Thinks that pdfedit-0.4.5 is dated...


o "Document Viewer (Evince) SHOULD be able to fill in forms, IF the 
document is a fillable form.  Not all documents are fillable! 
If document does not support form filling the form, you should 
use tools like PDFedit or OpenOffice Draw"

NOTE: Evince does not work on:
~/git/disability/concentra/pdf/Records_Release-20211203.pdf

OpenOffice Draw might work but obnoxious application
PDFedit 

Trying out okular universal document viewer that I have installed.

.ICEauthority
  "Basically ICE is a inter process communication
  protocol, with authentication, protocol negotiation 
  and potentially multiplexing built in.

  It allows two X clients to talk directly to each 
  other, for example, a video player program could 
  potentially talk to a jukebox program to update each 
  other.

  As Richard Holloway says, the .ICEAuthority file is 
  for authentication.  It contains a number of random 
  cookies.  If two programs have the same cookie, then 
  they're allowed to talk to each other.  In practice
  this either means that they're reading the same
  .ICEAuthority file, or the cookies have been added.

  In a lot of ways it's similar to the xauth program
  the .Xauthority file, except that .ICEAuthority is
  used for client to client, while .Xauthority is for
  client to server."

.Xauthority
  "The .Xauthority (not .xAuthority) file can be found in
  each user home directory and is used to store credentials
  in cookies used by xauth for authentication of X sessions.
  Once an X session is started, the cookie is used to
  authenticate connections to that specific display.  You
  can find more info on X authentication and X authority in
  the xauth man pages (type man xauth in a terminal).

  So, if you are not the owner of this file you can't login
  since you can't store your credentials there."
