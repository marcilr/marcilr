# "GOPATH is a variable that defines the root of your workspace.
# By default, the workspace directory is a directory that is
# named go within your user home directory (~/go for Linux and
# MacOS, %USERPROFILE%/go for Windows). GOPATH stores your code
# base and all the files that are necessary for your development.
# You can use another directory as your workspace by configuring
# GOPATH for different scopes. GOPATH is the root of your
# workspace and contains the following folders:
#
# src/: location of Go source code (for example, .go, .c, .g, .s).
# pkg/: location of compiled package code (for example, .a).
# bin/: location of compiled executable programs built by Go."
