in a telehealth consultation.

2. My health care provider explained to me how the video conferencing 
technology that will be used to affect such a consultation will

3. I understand that a telehealth consultation has potential benefits
including easier access to care and the convenience of meeting from
a location of my choosing.

4. I understand there are potential risks to this technology, including
interruptions, unauthorized access, and technical difficulties.
I understand that my health care provider or I can discontinue the
telehealth consult/visit if it is felt that the videoconferencing 
connections are not adequate for the situation.

5. I have had a direct conversation with my provider, during which I 
had the opportunity to ask questions in regard to this procedure.

responsible for the delivery of any healthcare, medical advice or care.

Neuropsychological Evaluation Informed Consent Referral Source: A referral was made for a neuropsychological assessment. Nature and Purpose of Assessment: The goal of neuropsychological assessment is to determine if any changes have occurred to the client's attention, memory, language, problem solving, or other cognitive functions. A neuropsychological assessment may point to changes in brain function and suggest possible methods of treatment for rehabilitation. The assessment starts with an interview where we will be asking questions about the client's background and current medical and mental health symptoms. Additionally, we may be using different techniques and standardized tests including, but not limited to, asking questions about your knowledge of certain topics, reading, drawing figures and shapes, listening to recordings, viewing printed material, computer questionnaires, manipulating objects, etc. Foreseeable Risks, Discomforts, and Benefits: For some individuals assessments can cause fatigue, frustration, and anxiousness. Please discuss specific concerns with Dr. Stocker. Fees and Time Commitment: The cost for this assessment is estimated to be as discussed with our office. The assessment can take up to eight hours of face-to-face testing in addition to an additional eight hours spent scoring, interpretation, and report preparation, which occurs on a different day than the testing. Once records have been received and reviewed, and the evaluation is complete, we will meet again for a feedback session where you are provided the results of the evaluation. Though the fees may be covered by insurance, clients are responsible for all fees for the assessment. We verify insurance coverage as a courtesy; however, this is not a guarantee of accuracy or payment. It is your responsibility to verify your coverage and benefits. Any balance remaining after insurance reimbursement is the client’s responsibility. Additionally, clients are responsible for any no-show fees that may be applicable. Clients are also responsible for any fees and reimbursement for time spent by office staff regarding disputed credit card charges. Release of Information: As documented in our Notice of Privacy Practices and Limits of Confidentiality, HIPAA permits us to correspond with treatment providers, including treating physicians who are involved in your care, for continuity of care even upon rescinding signed Release of Information forms. If there is an objection to releasing information, you will need to put the request in writing and submit it to our office. Upon receiving, we will review the request and decide if it is feasible and appropriate. Subpoenas and Testifying in Court: Should Dr. Stocker be subpoenaed and required to testify in court, payment must be secured ahead of time. Payment for services are charged on a full-day (8 hours) basis at $330 per hour. Travel time must also be reimbursed. Additional payment for court preparation will be charged on an as-needed basis. Consultation: Case consultation with other licensed professionals may occur for various reasons; however, no identifiable information will be shared. I have read and agree with the nature and purpose of this assessment and to each of the points listed above. I have had an opportunity to ask and clarify all questions and discuss any points of concern before signing.

13. Limits of Confidentiality
Autosaved at 9:51 am on 10/25/2021
Psychological Services Group, LLC

Information discussed in the neuropsychological or psychological evaluation will be incorporated into a final report. This report will be sent to the referring source and any other individuals/agencies identified on the Release of Neuropsychological Evaluation form signed during the first appointment. The client may request the final report be sent to another person or agency at any time in the future by completing an additional release form. If the fee for this evaluation is being paid by an insurance company or other agency, it may be necessary to send a copy of the report to that agency to secure reimbursement. This report, and any other information discussed in the evaluation, is confidential, and it will not be shared without written permission except under the following conditions: • The client threatens suicide; • The client threatens harm to another person(s); • The client reports suspected child abuse; • The client reports abuse of the elderly. State law mandates mental health professionals may need to report these situations to the appropriate persons or agencies. Additionally, if the client is involved in a legal action and claims mental health issues related to the legal action (i.e., plea of “Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity,” or claiming emotional harm in a lawsuit), mental health records may be required to be released. Finally, there may be other situations where release is permitted by law, but Psychological Services Group, LLC will limit such release to the minimum necessary to meet the legal requirements. Communications between Psychological Services Group, LLC and the client will otherwise be deemed confidential as stated under Alaska state law. I have read and understand the above information, and I agree to the limits of confidentiality.
